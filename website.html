<!--
    Link to another website using HTML:
    the "a" in <a> refers to "anchor"
        <a>Link to YouTube</a> 
        this creates a sentence displayed but doesn't take us to youtube
    
        <a href="paste_URL_link_here">Link to YouTube</a>
        this will create a reference to another website inside our website

    href: is an attribute
    a space is reuired between a tag name and attribute
    "href": attribute name
    "= "" ": is called attribute value

    we can add another attribute:
    Open in new tab or Current tab
    How?
        by default in opens in the same tab
        but if we set the attribute to _blank: it will open to new tab
